      <p class="text-lg">
        Welcome. I'm Chris (avrg), a Security Specialist focused on Cyber Defence and Strategy. My expertise lies in Incident Response and Detection Engineering.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg">
        My approach is driven by a core philosophy: an effective defense demands a thorough understanding of offensive practices.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg">
        I believe that this is not a common view of many professionals and security teams are too often silo'd into their individual specialisations, resulting in weaker security posture and lack of fulfillment. It's just not good for anyone.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg">
        I focus on deconstructing technical concepts and viewing defensive security through the eyes of an attacker.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg">
        This site serves as a record of my work. Here, I'll be sharing insights on Detection Engineering, Incident Response, and Security Research, along with my analysis of Cyber Strategy and building resilient defenses.
      </p>
