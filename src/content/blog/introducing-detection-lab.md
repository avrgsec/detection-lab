I've rebuilt Detection Lab from the ground up!

## What's New

- Modern, minimal design
- Integrated blog for technical writeups
- Faster page loads
- Better mobile experience
- Auto-generated detection pages

## What Stays the Same

All my existing Sigma detections are still here, now with:
- Individual pages for each detection
- Better formatting and display
- MITRE ATT&CK links
- One-click downloads

## What's Next

I'm building a testing lab to validate each detection in live environments. 

Future posts will cover:
- Testing methodology
- Lab setup guides
- Detection validation processes
- Lessons learned

Check out the new [Detection Lab](/) and let me know what you think!
